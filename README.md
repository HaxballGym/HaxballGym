# HaxBallGym

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

This is a python package that can be used to treat the game [HaxBall](https://www.haxball.com) as though it were an [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com)-style environment for Reinforcement Learning projects.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.7

## Installation

Install the library via pip:

```
pip install haxballgym
```

That's it! Run `example.py` to see if the installation was successful. The script assumes you have a recordings folder from where you run the script.

## Recordings

To watch the recordings, go to my [HaxBall clone](https://wazarr94.github.io/) and load the recording file.
